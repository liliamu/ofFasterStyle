# ofFasterStyle

This is an openFrameworks realtime implementation of https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, using the ir image from a kinect as input to the style transfer net. The models are loaded as binary protobuffers with the varhack as seen in https://github.com/memo/ofxMSATensorFlow.

## The trained models are in the release
https://github.com/olekristensen/ofFasterStyle/releases/tag/v0.8

## Thanks to
Lilia Amundsen, the master student who initiated this project
DEIC, the super computing guys who let us grind our teeth with this little project on Abacus 2.0 
Logan Engstrom, whose tensorflow implementation of a fast style transfer network provided a good starting point for learning.
