# ofFasterStyle

This is an openFrameworks realtime implementation of https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer, using the ir image from a kinect as input to the style transfer net. The models are loaded as binary protobuffers with the varhack as seen in https://github.com/memo/ofxMSATensorFlow.
